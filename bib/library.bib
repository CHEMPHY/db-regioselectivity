	abstract={A method for the synthesis of bromobenzene derivs. is reported here.  NBS/H2SO4-HOAc as a bromination agent leads to a direct bromination of some strongly deactivated arom. compds. such as 1,3-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzene with good results.  The effects of reaction conditions, such as the ratio of sulfuric acid to acetic acid, reaction temp., addn. time and the ratio of NBS to reactants were investigated and the optimized reaction conditions were detd.  An excellent yield (93.1\%) was obtained when 1,3-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzene reacted with 1.15 equiv NBS at H2SO4/HOAc at ratio of 6:1 at 45{\textdegree} for 8 h. [on SciFinder(R)]},
